# Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data exploration to model deployment using popular machine learning techniques.

# Introduction
The Iris Flower Classification project is built using the famous Iris dataset, which is a simple and well-known dataset used for demonstrating machine learning classification problems. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which consists of 150 samples and 4 features:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:
* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica
The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via the UCI Machine Learning Repository or loaded directly using sklearn.datasets.

#  Technologies Used
* Python (Programming Language)
* Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization)
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library)
* Streamlit (Model Deployment)
